This logic is for the Enterpoint Spartan-3 based PCI fpga card.

The code needs to be built with the Xilinx tools. You can
download the Xilinx tools for free from xilinx.com. It also
generates a bit of the VHDL by perl, so you need that installed
also.

Steps to building & using this code:

1) Install Linux (it should include perl)
2) Download and install the Xilinx WebPack for Linux
	* It's about 1GB and Xilinx provides it for free
	* The Xilinx tools include a settings.sh file
	  that you need to run to add the tools to your path
3) Run make to synthisize the image
4) program your card over jtag with XC3prog
	xc3sprog pci_7seg.bit
